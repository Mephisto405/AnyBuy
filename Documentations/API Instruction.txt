In this program, every single thing which wants the server to process must send a String with in assigned pattern. Or, the server will not understand what to do and will not process the request.

When requesting user registration, please send reg&<email>?<passcode>&useSSL=true . For example, when a user is register using email as sample@123.com with password test.123, the Android APP should send "reg&sample@123.com?test.123&useSSL=true".

When requesting user login, please send lgi&<email>?<passcode>&useSSL=true to the server.

WARNING: Except registration and login function, every function defined in class CoreOperations.java, must go thru a session validation (ie sessionVeriy() ) before they can really do something. A function MUST return immediately unless the responding code of sessionVerify() is "0x01 ".
